** These are the all SQL Queries that I know **
selects all the records in the table: SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME;
select statement used to select column or columns from table: SELECT COLUMN_1,COLUMN_2,... FROM TABLE_NAME;
SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct values: SELECT DISTINCT COLUMN1,COLUMN2.. FROM TABLE_NAME;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT..).. USED TO COUNT DISTINT VALUES SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT COLUMN1) FROM TABLE_NAME;
AS KEYWORD IS USED TO NAME THE RESULT COLUMN
Eg:SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);
output:
DistinctCountries
21
WHERE clause is used to filter the records: SELECT COLUMN1,COLUMN2,... FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE CONDITION;
WHERE CAN BE USED IN SELECT UPDATE DELETE CLAUSES.
OPERATORS FOR WHERE CLAUSE = < > <> >= <= BETWEEN LIKE IN
conditions in WHERE clause can be combined with AND OR NOT operators
SELECT COLUMN1,COLOMN2,... FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE CONDITION1 AND CONDITION2 AND CONDITION3...;
SELECT COLUMN1,COLOMN2,... FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE CONDITION1 OR CONDITION2 OR CONDITION3...;
SELECT COLUMN1,COLOMN2,... FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE NOT CONDITION1
we can use AND OR NOT all together in one statement.
ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in descending ascending order:
SELECT COLUMN1,COLUMN2,.. FROM TABLE_NAME ORDER BY COLUMN1 ASC, COLUMN2 DESC,COLUMN3 ASC,....;
